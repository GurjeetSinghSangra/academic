**About me**
---

I am a student of a Masterâ€™s degree in *[Data science](https://datascience.math.unipd.it/curricula/machine-learning-for-intelligent-systems/)* at the **University of Padova**, and I have been part of one year Eramsus exchange program at the **Univeristy of Helsinki**.

I am currently working on my master's thesis within the *[Machine and Human Intelligence](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence)* (Helsinki) research group on **Bayesian Optimization**, supervised by *[prof. Luigi Acerbi](http://luigiacerbi.com/)* (UniHe) and *[prof. Francesco Rinaldi](https://www.math.unipd.it/~rinaldi/) (UniPD co-supervisor)*.<br/> My research aims to extend the existing *[BADS (Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/df0aab058ce179e4f7ab135ed4e641a9-Abstract.html)* algorithm (developed by prof. Acerbi), by exploiting approaches based on Adaptive Direct Search methods, Gaussian Process (GP), and Bayesian inference
methods.The main goal is to improve its convergence towards the minima point of expensive, stochastic and non-smooth
functions and increase stability.

**Research Interest**
---

I am fascinated by probabilistic models and Bayesian inference methods applied to Machine Learning problems.
My ideal contribution to the research would be like to bridge the gap between black-box and white-box models, using probabilistic models that quantify uncertainty and define priors over data to build sample efficient algorithms, under resource constraints limitation.<br/><br/>

Research topics of interest:

  * [Probabilistic Numeric](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/)
  * Stochastic Optimization
  * Bayesian Inference methods
  * Machine Learning and Deep Learning
  * Reinforcement Learning
