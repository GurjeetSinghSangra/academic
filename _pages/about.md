**About me**
---
Hi! I am a Ph.D student from the University of Geneva at the [DMML](http://dmml.ch/) group, under the supervision of prof. [Alexandros Kalousis](http://dmml.ch/alexandros-kalousis/) and prof. [Stephane Marchand-Maillet](https://vision.unige.ch/stephanemarchandmaillet).

Previously during my Master's degree in [Data science](https://datascience.math.unipd.it/) (University of Padova), I joined the [Machine and Human Intelligence](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence) (University of Helsinki) under the supervision of prof. [Luigi Acerbi](http://luigiacerbi.com/).<br> During this period, I worked on my *[master's thesis](https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/42162)* for developing a Python version of BADS (Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search, [Acerbi and Ma, 2017](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/df0aab058ce179e4f7ab135ed4e641a9-Abstract.html)), called PyBADS ([Singh and Acerbi, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15576)). The work also involved the investigation of the algorithm convergence towards stationary points of non-smooth stochastic functions.

**Research Interest**
---

I am fascinated by Probabilistic models and Bayesian inference methods.<br>
My research focuses on **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)** and spans Generative Models and Optimization problems.

Research **topics** of interest:

  * Likelihood-free inference
  * Stochastic Optimization
  * [Probabilistic Numeric](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/)
  * Bayesian Inference techniques
  * Deep Learning
