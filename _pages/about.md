**[Looking for a PhD]**

I am a student of a Masterâ€™s degree in *[Data science](https://datascience.math.unipd.it/curricula/machine-learning-for-intelligent-systems/)* at the **University of Padova**, and I have been part of one year Eramsus exchange program at **Helsinki Univeristy**.

I am currently working on my master's thesis within the *[Machine and Human Intelligence](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence)* (Helsinki) research group on **Bayesian Optimization** problems, supervised by *[prof. Luigi Acerbi](http://luigiacerbi.com/)* (UniHe) and *[prof. Francesco Rinaldi](https://www.math.unipd.it/~rinaldi/) (UniPD co-supervisor)*. My thesis's research tries to extend the existing *[BADS (Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/df0aab058ce179e4f7ab135ed4e641a9-Abstract.html)* algorithm (developed by prof. Acerbi), by exploiting new approaches, based on Bayesian inference, to improve its convergence and stability towards minima points of expensive and non-smooth functions.
