**About me**
---
Hi! I am a Ph.D student from the University of Geneva at the [DMML](http://dmml.ch/) group.
My research focuses on **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)** and spans Generative Models and Optimization problems.

Previously during my Master's degree in [Data science](https://datascience.math.unipd.it/curricula/machine-learning-for-intelligent-systems/), I joined the [Machine and Human Intelligence](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence) (University of Helsinki) under the supervision of prof. [Luigi Acerbi](http://luigiacerbi.com/). During this period, I develop my *[master's thesis](https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/42162)* based on the existing [BADS (Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/df0aab058ce179e4f7ab135ed4e641a9-Abstract.html) algorithm. The main goal of the master's thesis was the porting of BADS to Python and the investigation of the algorithm convergence towards stationary points of non-smooth stochastic functions.

**Research Interest**
---

I am fascinated by probabilistic models and Bayesian inference methods applied to Machine Learning problems.
My ideal contribution to the research would be like to bridge the gap between black-box and white-box models, using probabilistic models that quantify uncertainty and define priors over data to build sample efficient algorithms, under resource constraints limitation.<br/><br/>

Research topics of interest:

  * [Probabilistic Numeric](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/)
  * Stochastic Optimization
  * Bayesian Inference methods
  * Machine Learning and Deep Learning
  * Reinforcement Learning
